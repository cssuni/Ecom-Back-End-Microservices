# Ecom-Back-End-Microservices

Absolutely! Here's a concise yet comprehensive description you can use for your e-commerce application on GitHub. Feel free to tweak it to fit your specific project details:

---

# **E-Commerce Application**

## Overview

This project is an E-Commerce application built using **Spring Boot** and **microservice architecture**. It aims to provide a scalable, robust, and flexible platform for managing an online store. The application features a modular design, enabling easy integration of additional services and components.

---

## **Features**

### **Product Management**

- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Create, read, update, and delete products.
  - Support for bulk uploads via CSV/JSON.
  - Soft delete (archive) products instead of permanent deletion.
- **Product Attributes**:
  - Store product details: name, description, price, SKU, category, stock quantity, and image URLs.
  - Support for product variants (e.g., size, color).

### **Search & Filtering**

- Search products by name, description, or SKU.
- Filter by category, price range, ratings, and availability.
- Sort by price, popularity, or date added.

### **Inventory Management**

- Real-time stock tracking.
- Automatic stock deductions on order placements and restorations on cancellations.
- Low-stock alerts via events or notifications.

### **Categories & Tags**

- Create and manage product categories (e.g., Electronics, Clothing).
- Assign tags for advanced filtering (e.g., "Wireless", "Organic").

### **Image Management**

- Upload product images to cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).
- Support multiple images per product.

---

## **Integration**

- **Order Service**:  
  - Validate product availability during order creation.
  - Deduct stock via API calls or events (e.g., Kafka/RabbitMQ).

- **Auth Service**:  
  - Verify JWT tokens for role-based access (Admin vs. Customer).

- **Recommendation Service**:  
  - Provide product details for personalized recommendations.

- **Monitoring & Logging**:  
  - Export metrics to Prometheus/Grafana.
  - Log critical events (e.g., stock updates, product deletions).

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

### **Performance**

- Response Time: < 500 ms for core APIs (e.g., fetching products).
- Caching: Use Redis to cache frequently accessed products and categories.
- Scalability: Handle 10,000+ concurrent requests with horizontal scaling.

### **Security**

- Authentication: Integrate with Auth Service for JWT validation.
- Authorization:  
  - Only admins can create/update/delete products.
  - Customers can only view products.
- Input Validation: Sanitize and validate all inputs.

### **Observability**

- Monitoring: Track API latency, error rates, and database health.
- Logging: Centralized logs (e.g., ELK Stack) for auditing and debugging.
- Alerts: Notify admins for critical failures (e.g., stock update failures).

### **Data Management**

- Database: PostgreSQL for ACID compliance (transactions for stock updates).
- Backups: Daily backups of product data.
- Migrations: Use Flyway/Liquibase for schema versioning.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (relational data), Redis (caching).
- **Event Streaming**: Kafka/RabbitMQ for async communication.
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 or MinIO for product images.
- **Containerization**: Docker for packaging, Kubernetes for orchestration.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

- JDK 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- PostgreSQL
- Docker & Docker Compose

### **Steps**

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-application.git
    cd ecommerce-application
    ```

2. Configure the database settings in `application.properties`:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/productdb
    spring.datasource.username=yourusername
    spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
    ```

3. Build the application:
    ```sh
    mvn clean install
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```sh
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

5. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

## **Usage**

- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/products` - Fetch all products.
  - `/api/products/{id}` - Fetch a product by ID.
  - `/api/products` - Create a new product (Admin only).
  - `/api/products/{id}` - Update a product (Admin only).
  - `/api/products/{id}` - Soft delete a product (Admin only).
  - `/api/products/bulk` - Bulk upload products.
